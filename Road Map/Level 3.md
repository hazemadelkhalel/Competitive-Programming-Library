# Level 3
Duration: 30 rokba days or more.

Target: be able to solve CF-div2 ABCD(E)

### Content
* Sparse Table
* LCA
* Euler's Graph
* DP (ranges - bitmask - digits ... etc)
* Segment tree
* Segment tree with lazy propagation
* Trie 
* KMP algorithm - Z algorithm
* Rabin Karb

## Timeline
To use this plan:
 - For coaches: each point of the content takes a week (1 session for teaching + 1 session for upsolving the sheat)
 - For trainees: try to master each point in at most (3-5) days (learning + finishing the sheet)
